# Enactushacks Website
NodeJS powered website for Western's EnactusHacks. Users will be able to stay up-to-date with the hackathon as well as submitting an application to participate. As well, the site will switch into a "live mode" during the competition to allow users to interact with sponsors and submit their projects for judging.
