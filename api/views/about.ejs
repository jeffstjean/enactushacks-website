                Each project has two components: a technical demo, and a feasibility presentation.

                <br>
                Teams must be composed of students from both STEM (e.g. computer science) and non-STEM (e.g. social science) backgrounds to compete.

            <p class="text-small u-vertical-margin-small">
                A: Business is nearly impossible without technology. Whether you're in banking, accounting, consulting, marketing, or any other industry, it's nearly guaranteed that working on technology will be at the core of your work.
                EnactusHacks will prepare you for this workforce better than any other event in Canada.<br>
                <br>
                Not only will you bolster your business skills by working on your feasbility pitch, attending workshops, and networking with top companies,
                you'll have the unique opportunity to work alongside technical individuals building new technology right in front of your eyes. Your job is to keep them on track towards building a solution that's feasible and impactful - just like you would in the real world.

            <p class="text-small u-vertical-margin-small">
                A: Technology is never developed in a vaccuum. In the workplace, developers have to deal with business requirements, designers, budgets, and non-technical coworkers every day to do their jobs.<br>
                <br>
                Hackathons usually teach you new technical skills, but often neglect the business side of technology. At EnactusHacks, we do both.<br>
                <br>
                Not only will you bolster your tech skills by building a technical demo, attending workshops, and networking with top companies,
